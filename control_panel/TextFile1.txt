start in gif frame -> use gif function to to insert generic pic

main should call the window and then call grey scale in main not window.py

Remember each class is its own fucntions and abilities, while coding window. App_design is the handler of the gif,msg,terminal frame classes
for example; in App_design, there is a function to toggle with gif's connection functions.
